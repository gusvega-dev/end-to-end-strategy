# Security & Governance

Security is foundational to DevOps maturity. This strategy layers GitHub, Azure, and workflow-based security controls for end-to-end protection, traceability, and compliance.

---

## 1. GitHub Security Controls

### a. Branch Protection
- Enable on `main`, `release/qat`, and `release/prod`
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks (CI/CD workflows)
- Prevent force pushes and deletions

### b. Secret Scanning
- Enable GitHub’s built-in secret scanning
- Add custom patterns if needed

### c. Dependabot Alerts
- Enable security alerts for vulnerable packages
- Configure PRs for dependency updates

### d. Actions Settings
- Restrict to verified actions only
- Allow only selected workflows (for example, no forks can deploy)

---

## 2. Secrets Management

### GitHub Encrypted Secrets
- Define secrets per environment (e.g. `dev`, `prod`)
- Use with `secrets.ENV_VAR` in workflows
- Rotate secrets quarterly

### Azure Key Vault Integration (Optional)
- Store secrets in Key Vault
- Use GitHub OpenID Connect + federated credentials for secretless auth
- Access secrets via Azure CLI in workflows

---

## 3. Least Privilege IAM

- Azure service principals should have:
  - `Contributor` or `Owner` on `dev`
  - `Reader` on `prod` (for read-only validation)
  - Specific roles like `Data Factory Contributor`, `Key Vault Secrets User`
- Use separate service principals per environment if needed

---

## 4. Auditing & Compliance

- GitHub Actions logs all jobs, users, and timestamps
- GitHub Environments track all deployments
- Use GitHub Releases for immutable versioning + tagging
- Store `terraform plan` and `.pbix` artifacts per version

---

## 5. Additional Hardening

- Enable 2FA or SSO for all contributors
- Use CODEOWNERS to enforce review from required teams
- Store `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SECURITY.md`
- Audit repo collaborators and permissions quarterly

## Summary: Governance Matrix

| Area                | Practice                                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Code Safety         | Branch protections, PR checks, reviews      |
| Secret Management   | GitHub Secrets + Key Vault + OIDC           |
| Infra Permissions   | Least privilege RBAC per environment        |
| Observability       | GitHub Actions logs, audit trails           |
| Release Traceability| Tags, changelogs, project linkage           |
| Vulnerability Mgmt  | Dependabot, GitHub Advanced Security        |

> Governance is not about red tape — it's about giving your team the freedom to move fast **without breaking things.**
