# Release Management Strategy

An effective release strategy provides traceability, governance, and confidence in promoting changes to production. This setup combines automation with manual approval workflows.

## Release Flow

| Stage       | Triggered From     | Deploys To | Notes                          |
|-------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------------|
| Dev         | Push to `main`     | `dev`      | Auto-deploys                    |
| QA          | Create `release/qat` | `qat`    | Manual promotion, auto-deploy   |
| Production  | PR to `release/prod` | `prod`   | Manual promotion, review gated |

## Version Tagging

Tags are auto-generated when pushing to `release/prod`:

```yaml
VERSION="v$(date +'%Y.%m.%d-%H%M')"
git tag $VERSION
git push origin $VERSION
```

## GitHub Release

After tagging:
- Create a GitHub Release using the tag
- Include:
  - Summary of changes
  - Linked issues/PRs
  - Contributors

## Changelog Management

Use `docs/release-notes.md` to maintain human-readable logs:

```md
## v2025.04.01-1430
- ✅ Added ADF Import Pipeline
- ✅ Improved Function Logging
- ✅ Refactored Terraform NSG module
```

You can automate changelogs using GitHub CLI or bots like [`release-drafter`](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter).

## What to Include in a Release

- Completed sprint stories or epics
- QA-passed bugfixes
- Infra changes tested in lower environments

## Best Practices

- Create a release at the end of each sprint
- Use semantic or timestamp-based tagging
- Link PRs to GitHub Project cards for traceability
- Validate in `qat` before merge to `release/prod`

## Optional Enhancements

- Integrate with GitHub Deployments API for dashboards
- Notify teams via Slack/Teams on release tagging
- Sign/tag container artifacts and `.pbix`, `.zip`, `.plan` files
