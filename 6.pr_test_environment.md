# PR Test Environment & Validation

To ensure code is functional and safe before reaching `main`, we deploy all PRs to a **shared `test` environment**. This enables end-to-end validation using real infrastructure.

## Purpose

- Detect runtime issues early
- Validate infra and app changes together
- Enable testers/stakeholders to preview before merge
- Reduce friction during QA/UAT

## GitHub Environment: `test`

- Defined in GitHub → Settings → Environments → `test`
- Secrets stored here for safe access by Actions
- Optional: Add reviewers to gate deploys

## Triggering

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

## CI/CD Logic

In `ci-cd.yml`, the deploy steps for `test` run on pull request events:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-test:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    environment: test
    steps:
      - run: echo 'Deploying changed components to TEST env...'
```

## Change Detection

Using `dorny/paths-filter`, we detect what folders changed in the PR:

```yaml
outputs:
  adf: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.adf }}
  functions: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.functions }}
```

Then, only deploy the affected components:

```yaml
if: needs.detect-changes.outputs.functions == 'true'
```

## Resource Naming (Recommended)

Use naming like:
- `project-adf-test`
- `project-fn-test`
- `project-tf-test`

Keep resources isolated but shared between PRs (not ephemeral unless necessary).

## Cleanup (Optional)

You can optionally clean test environments on PR close:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo 'Destroying test deployment...'
```

## Benefits

- Reduces bugs in `main`
- Builds trust with stakeholders
- Allows integration checks before merge
- Improves cycle time by catching issues earlier
