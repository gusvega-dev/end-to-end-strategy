# Environment Setup

Environments in GitHub provide control, isolation, and governance for deployments across the SDLC. This strategy defines shared and protected environments for safe, auditable delivery.

## Environments

| Name    | Purpose                  | Deployment Branch       | Notes                             |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `test`  | PR validation            | PRs from `feature/*`     | Shared; lightweight verification |
| `dev`   | Integration/dev testing  | `main`                   | Auto-deploy from trunk           |
| `qat`   | QA/UAT & pre-prod        | `release/qat`            | Approval-gated                   |
| `prod`  | Production               | `release/prod`           | Highly protected, manual review  |

## Configuration in GitHub

Go to `Settings > Environments` in your GitHub repository and create:

- **Environment Name:** (e.g., `test`)
- **Secrets:** Add environment-specific secrets like:
  - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
  - `ADF_RESOURCE_GROUP`
  - `TF_BACKEND_CONFIG`
- **Protection Rules:**
  - Required reviewers for `qat` and `prod`
  - Wait timer (optional)
  - Environment secrets visible only to GitHub Actions jobs targeting that environment

## Why This Matters

- Environments enforce separation of duties
- Prevent accidental prod deployments
- Enable progressive rollouts
- Improve audit and traceability

## Best Practices

- Use same naming in GitHub, pipelines, and infrastructure configs
- Avoid sharing secrets between environments
- Use `environment:` field in GitHub Actions to scope access:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: dev
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Infra
        run: terraform apply
```

## Secrets Management

- Use GitHub Encrypted Secrets
- Rotate secrets periodically
- For sensitive workloads, integrate with Azure Key Vault
